Overview
This project is a Simple Web Vulnerability Scanner built using Django. It is designed to help users test websites for common vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Security Misconfigurations. By taking a domain, URL, or IP address as input, the scanner performs a series of automated checks and reports on potential security issues.

Features
1. URL Validation: Ensures that the input contains the correct protocol (http:// or https://) and checks if the target website is reachable.
2. SQL Injection (SQLi) Testing: Detects SQL injection vulnerabilities in forms by using a series of payloads.
3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing: Checks for the presence of XSS vulnerabilities by injecting scripts into input fields.
4. Security Misconfigurations: Tests for common security misconfigurations such as missing security headers and improperly configured SSL certificates.
5. Progress Loader: Displays a loader while performing scans, providing users with feedback during the scan process.
6. Results Page: Presents the findings from the vulnerability scans, including whether the host is reachable and if any vulnerabilities were detected.

How It Works
Input: The user provides a domain, URL, or IP address through a form.
Validation: The system validates the input to ensure itâ€™s a proper URL and that the host is reachable.
Scanning:
SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities are tested using pre-defined payloads.
The system checks for security misconfigurations, such as missing HTTP security headers.
SSL certificates are validated to ensure proper implementation.
Results: The user is redirected to a results page displaying the outcomes of the scan.


Technologies Used
- Django: Web framework used for building the backend and handling user input.
- Requests Library: To make HTTP requests and validate the target URL.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For building the frontend, including forms, loaders, and result displays.

Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-web-vulnerability-scanner.git

2.Run the application:
python manage.py runserver

How to Use
1.Open the web application in your browser.
2. Enter a domain or URL to scan.
4.View the scanning progress and results in real-time.
5. Review the findings on the results page, including any vulnerabilities found.
